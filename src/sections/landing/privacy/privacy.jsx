        To enhance your experience on planora.ca and simplify the subscription process, we offer you
        the option to connect or interact with third-party services such as Facebook and Instagram.
        When you use these third-party services to connect to planora.ca, we may transmit
        information about you to the providers of these services, who may in turn transmit
        information about you to us. When you authorize us to access your data via a third-party
        service to create a profile on the site, we may use this data for various purposes,
        including:
        <li style={{ paddingBottom: '15px' }}>
          Establishing automatic links in our system: For example, if you connect to us via a
          service with a public friends list, such as Facebook, we may check if some of your
          Facebook friends are also members of planora.ca. If we find a match, we may copy your
          Facebook relationship with these members by allowing them to become your fans,
          subscribers, or friends on our site.
        </li>
        <li style={{ paddingBottom: '15px' }}>
          Suggesting relationships: For example, if you connect via a service with a private contact
          list (such as Google and Yahoo!), we may check which of your contacts are site members and
          suggest that you become a fan of these users. This process is not automatic; you must
          choose to become a fan of the suggested users.
        </li>
        <li style={{ paddingBottom: '15px' }}>
          Compiling a list of potential friends to whom you can send emails: When users share
          content with their friends using, for example, the site's "Send to a Friend" function, we
          may use third-party friend lists to compile a list of contacts to whom you could send an
          email.
        </li>
        <li style={{ paddingBottom: '15px' }}>
          Compiling a list of potential friends to whom you can send messages on specific services:
          For example, we may use third-party friend lists to compile a list of contacts to whom you
          could send an invitation to watch an interactive presentation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Improving and personalizing your experience on the site: When you log in via a third-party
          service, we may access certain information from your account, such as your profile
          picture, popular news from your network, and your friends' comments on certain articles or

        2. HOW CAN THE USER MANAGE COOKIES?
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ pb: '30px', textAlign: 'justify' }}>
        The user is informed that the publisher's partners and other third parties may place cookies
        on the site. Only the issuer of a cookie can read or modify the information it contains, and
        the publisher has no access or control over cookies used by third parties. The issuance and
        use of cookies by third parties are governed by their own privacy policies, in addition to
        the provisions of this Policy. Therefore, it is recommended that the user consults the
        websites of these third parties for more information on the cookies they use and how to
        manage them. Regarding consent for cookies, the user is deemed to have given their consent
        in the following cases:
        <li>
          By clicking on the "X" icon or the "I understand" button on the information banner visible
          during their first connection to the Site.
        </li>
        <li>
          By continuing their navigation, i.e., when they click on an element of the Site (image,
          link, "search" button, etc.) or go to another page of the Site.
        </li>{' '}
        If the user accepts the storing of cookies on their terminal via their browsing software,
        cookies integrated into the pages and content visited will be temporarily stored in a
        dedicated space on their terminal, readable only by their issuer. This consent given by the
        user is valid for a period of thirteen (13) months from the first deposit of cookies on the
        terminal equipment. In case of refusal to store cookies on their terminal or deletion of
        those already stored, the user is informed that their navigation and experience on the site
        or application may be limited. This could also affect the recognition, for technical
        compatibility purposes, of the type of browser used, language and display settings, or the
        country of Internet connection. The publisher declines any responsibility for consequences
        related to the degraded operation of services resulting from the user's refusal of cookies
        or the publisher's inability to store or access cookies necessary for their operation due to
        the user's choice. The user has the option to configure their browsing software to allow the
        storage of cookies on their terminal or, on the contrary, to refuse them, either
        systematically or according to the issuer. They can also choose to configure their browsing
        software to prompt them to accept or refuse cookies on a case-by-case basis before they are
        stored on their terminal. Methods for managing cookies and user preferences vary by browser.
        Detailed instructions for making these changes are available in the browser's help menu,
        allowing the user to understand how to adjust their cookie preferences.
